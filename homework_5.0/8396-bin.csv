8396-bin,24,"mafia, the FBI found a notebook with a few weird annotations.",
8396-bin,25,"[+] Trying to use the same strategy as the last time, all the FBI experts",
8396-bin,26,failed to translate the book,
8396-bin,27,Look if you have some luck!,
8396-bin,28,[+] Type start to read the first note: start,
8396-bin,29,Openning the book...,
8396-bin,30,The answer is:,
8396-bin,31,Every round the challenge gave us 3 different elements in the same format:,(I)
8396-bin,32,"The first element (NEHQAOBYXUGDZMPSKFRIJVWLCT) is always a 26 chars string, a strong indicator of a substitution alphabet",(I)
8396-bin,33,"The second element (2) is always a number between 1 and 26, which seems like an offset",(I)
8396-bin,34,"It could be related to a rotation, like in a Caesar Cipher",(I) 33
8396-bin,35,The last element is probably the encrypted message itself.,(I)
8396-bin,36,With these informations in mind we confirmed there were indeed both a substitution and a rotation involved,"(A) 32,33,34,35"
8396-bin,37,"To decrypt, we first substituted back the message according to the alphabet, and then applied a rotation according to the offset.",(A) 36
8396-bin,38,The code below gave us what we needed:,
8396-bin,39,continue,
8396-bin,40,continue,
8396-bin,41,continue,
8396-bin,42,"rot = rotate(sub, offset)",
