2566-bin,33,Blame,
2566-bin,34,Description: I created a program for an unsolveable equation system,
2566-bin,35,My friend somehow forced it to solve the equations,(I)
2566-bin,36,Can you tell me how he did it?,
2566-bin,37,Write-up,
2566-bin,38,The service shows a static equation (it's always the same) and asks us to solve it.,(I)
2566-bin,39,Solve the following equations:,
2566-bin,40,Enter the solution X:,
2566-bin,41,"Since X has to be larger than 1337, there's no normal solution for this equation",(I)
2566-bin,42,"We'll have to pass a value, which will overflow the 32 bit integer result.",(A) 41
2566-bin,43,If we now just add 2^32 the value would result to:,(A) 41
2566-bin,44,"The service will then try to stuff this into the 32 bit integer value, cutting off the leading 1, resulting again in:",(I)
2566-bin,45,So we just have to find a value for x that results in 4294968633,(I)
2566-bin,46,Solve the following equations:,
2566-bin,47,Enter the solution X: 613566947,(A) 45
2566-bin,48,You entered: 613566947,
2566-bin,49,613566947 is bigger than 1337,
2566-bin,50,1337 is equal to 1337,
2566-bin,51,Well done!,
2566-bin,52,And there's our flag.,
