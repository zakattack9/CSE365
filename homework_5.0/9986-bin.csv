9986-bin,6,**This writeup proposes a method to craft payload in one request and get fmac,(I)
9986-bin,7,"Please pay attention that,",
9986-bin,8,"1, The length of the cmd matters because padding string can be \t \r \x0b \x0c etc",(I)
9986-bin,9,Command with length of 16 is OK.,(I)

9986-bin,11,We build 257 16-bytes blocks in total,"(A) 8,9"
9986-bin,12,The 2nd and 3rd blocks are padding of the whole blocks,(I)
9986-bin,13,The 1st block can be xored with the 257th block,(I)
9986-bin,14,The 4th - 128th blocks can be xored with 132th - 256th blocks,(I)
9986-bin,15,"So we have 129th - 131th blocks left, which corresponds to keys used for 1st - 3rd blocks",(I)
9986-bin,16,Thus we can break the system and get the flag.,"(A) 12,13,14,15"
